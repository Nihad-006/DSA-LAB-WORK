Lab 07: Graphs
This directory contains C and C++ implementations of fundamental graph data structures and common graph algorithms. It serves as a practical exploration of how graphs can be represented in memory and how to traverse or analyze them to solve pathfinding and spanning tree problems.

Graph Representations (Data Structures)
These files demonstrate different ways to store graph data in memory depending on the density of the graph and the specific operations required.

AdjacencyMatrix.c: Implements a graph using a 2D array (matrix). This is highly efficient for edge lookups and dense graphs but consumes 
O
(
V
2
)
 space.
AdjacencyList.c: Implements a graph using an array of linked lists. This is much more space-efficient for sparse graphs, using 
O
(
V
+
E
)
 space, and allows for efficient iteration over a vertex's neighbors.
EdgeList.c: Represents a graph simply as an unordered list (or array) of its edges. This is often used as the underlying structure for algorithms like Kruskal's.
Graph Algorithms
These files contain implementations of standard algorithms used to solve complex problems on graphs.

dijkstras.cpp: An implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm. This algorithm finds the shortest path from a single source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights.
kruskal.cpp: An implementation of Kruskal's Algorithm. This is a greedy algorithm used to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a connected, undirected, and weighted graph.
